# Data Analytics Coursework

A professional practice log of applied analytics work.  
This repository contains my solutions to structured analytics exercises and scenario-based problem sets that sharpen the same skills used in production data analyst roles: extracting insight, validating data, and communicating results clearly.

> **What this is:** an applied skills sandbox + evidence of consistent technical reps.  
> **What this isn’t:** a dump of school homework.
> > Note: While these started as coursework labs, I rewrite, expand, and reframe the best ones into real business-impact projects suitable for hiring review.

## 🚀 Featured Projects (Hiring-Focused)

Below are coursework labs I expanded into portfolio-quality analyses with real business framing:

- **Workforce & Compensation Data Wrangling**  
  Transformed a raw global developer survey into a clean, BI-ready dataset for **compensation benchmarking** and **workforce segmentation**, removing inconsistencies, handling missingness, and stabilizing salary outliers for reliable decision-making.
