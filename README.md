# Data Analytics Coursework (Applied Practice)

Welcome — this repo is my **professional practice log** for data analytics.  
It’s where I take structured labs and scenario problems and push them toward the same standard I’d use in a real analyst role: **clean logic, defensible decisions, and clear communication.**

**Think of this as:**
- an applied skills gym  
- proof of consistent reps  
- a place where I sharpen the exact workflow used in production analytics

**Not this:**
- a raw homework dump  
- copy-paste solutions with no context  
- “student-only” work

> *Many items started as coursework prompts, but I rewrite, expand, and reframe the strongest ones into business-impact projects suitable for hiring review.*

## ⭐ Featured Projects (Hiring-Focused)

These are coursework labs I upgraded into **portfolio-quality, real-world analyses**:

### **Workforce & Compensation Data Wrangling**
Cleaned and transformed a global developer survey into a **BI-ready dataset** for compensation benchmarking and workforce segmentation.  
Focused on standardizing categories, addressing missingness responsibly, and stabilizing salary outliers so the insights are **decision-grade**.

**Repo:** https://github.com/stalcup-dev/workforce-compensation-wrangling

### **Developer Compensation Analysis**
In-depth exploratory analysis of global developer compensation patterns with rigorous outlier handling and correlation testing.

**Repo:** https://github.com/stalcup-dev/dev-compensation-analysis

**Highlights:**
- Tukey 1.5×IQR outlier handling (~66% removed)
- 10-country comparison (US ~$143k median)
- Robustness check (salary–experience r ~0.15 → ~0.41 after filtering), job satisfaction near-zero correlation (r ~ -0.06)

**Tech:** Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels

If you’re reviewing this as a hiring manager:  
my goal is simple — show **how I think**, how I clean, and how I turn messy inputs into trustworthy insights.
