# Data Analytics Coursework (Applied Practice)

Welcome — this repo is my **professional practice log** for data analytics.  
It’s where I take structured labs and scenario problems and push them toward the same standard I’d use in a real analyst role: **clean logic, defensible decisions, and clear communication.**

**Think of this as:**
- an applied skills gym  
- proof of consistent reps  
- a place where I sharpen the exact workflow used in production analytics

**Not this:**
- a raw homework dump  
- copy-paste solutions with no context  
- “student-only” work

> *Many items started as coursework prompts, but I rewrite, expand, and reframe the strongest ones into business-impact projects suitable for hiring review.*

These are coursework labs I upgraded into **portfolio-quality, real-world analyses**:

### **Workforce & Compensation Data Wrangling**
Cleaned and transformed a global developer survey into a **BI-ready dataset** for compensation benchmarking and workforce segmentation.  
Focused on standardizing categories, addressing missingness responsibly, and stabilizing salary outliers so the insights are **decision-grade**.
